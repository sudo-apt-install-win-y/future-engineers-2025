### Power
We use 3 18650 batteries to provide 10.8 - 11.1 volts to our motor driver board. The motor driver board powers our DC Motor and Servo. To power our Raspberry Pi 4 B we have 2 more 18650 Batteries in a Waveshare UPS Hat B. This provides a stable power source to our Pi at 7.2 - 7.4 volts directly onto the Pi's power rails through Pogo Pins.

### Sensors
Our robot has 4 VL53L0X Time of Flight sensors situated with 2 on either side of our robot to give us the distances between the walls and our robot.
